Even the local fauna has grown more aggressive. When was the last time you have seen a pack of rats attack an armed traveller? That being is not alright, and should be dealt with, regardless of what my brother thinks about it. It should be as easy as smashing this boulder to pieces, then the creature.

Unfortunately for the rats, the locals spiders evolved to conceal themselves in the grass quite aptly. I wonder how many of them really live here? Nevertheless, the spiders love to munch on the rats. Just as much as the rats love to munch on the spiders' eggs. Their tiny battlefields leave behind enough organic matter for the tiger grass to slurp and grow even further. More grass means more nutrition for rats, just as more rats mean more nutrition for the spiders. This constant cycle of growth is just unbelievable. I am thinking of writing a book about it.

Growing up with him was tough, but we loved him nevertheless. At some point, his aggressivity became unbearable, and we chased him out. We hoped this was the last time we had to deal with him.

As tempting as it may sound, woe to those who try doing that. The gold coins attract attention of the Pond keeper. I do not know his name, but he certainly loves to challenge his summoners to a friendly potentially lethal duel. If you wish to prove your skills, you may try challenging him, too. Even one gold coin is enough. Be wary, for he does not return the offerings. You may need to drop a coin several times, as he sends his minions first to see if you're even worth duelling.

You see, a few moments ago, I tried to help this traveler pushing a cart across this bridge. However, he panicked, and pressed his mules harder to pull his cart. A little too harder, it seems. The mules misstepped and fell down onto the stalagmites along with the cart. The man looked at the scene in horror, and started to run. I understand it is hard to believe that such low price for Phrak bacon is suspicious, but I think he overreacted. I would like to set things right with him. He murmured something about being home soon to one of the mules before I approached them. Listen, would you mind dropping a good word for me? He probably lives nearby.
