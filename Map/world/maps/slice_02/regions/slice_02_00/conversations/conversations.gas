See, me and my brother have lived in this cavern for some time. We come from mating of a Cyclops and an Ice Giant, so we have no choice but to live in the wilderness on our own. Lately, this cave has been having a new inhabitant, an insect of sorts. My brother is of very peaceful nature, and is curious to see what will become of it. Myself, I see it as a threat. Even the local fauna has grown more aggressive. When was the last time you have seen a pack of rats attack an armed traveller? That being is not alright, and should be dealt with, regardless of what my brother thinks about it. It should be as easy as smashing this boulder to pieces, then the creature. However, my brother hid my club. Without it, neither can be done. Could you help? See if you can make him talk.";

See, the tiger grass is an ideal place for the rats to take shelter in. It is also delicious for them to chew on, I noticed. Unfortunately for the rats, the locals spiders evolved to conceal themselves in the grass quite aptly. I wonder how many of them really live here? Nevertheless, the spiders love to munch on the rats. Just as much as the rats love to munch on the spiders' eggs. Their tiny battlefields leave behind enough organic matter for the tiger grass to slurp and grow even further. More grass means more nutrition for rats, just as more rats mean more nutrition for the spiders. This constant cycle of growth is just unbelievable. I am thinking of writing a book about it. How would I name the phenomenon? Growthloop? Feastmutuality? Ecosystem? None of it sounds right. I need to contemplate on this further. I wonder how that new insect specimen fits into it. I even got into a fight with my brother over this...but that has been taken care of.";
