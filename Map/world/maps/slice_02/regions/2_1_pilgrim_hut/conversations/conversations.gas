Look, if you're not completely out of your mind. You need to prove your intentions first. Mules I can replace, but the cart not so much. So you and your krug friend should obtain me a new one. Past the fence by my hut there are is tree ripe for felling. I believe its wood would make a fine cart. Bring it outside the hut, and get busy with my tools. When the wagon is ready, I might be willing to speak with you krug friend.";
