// The first step to take is that we need to add chapters to the quests.gas.  The format of chapters is as follows:

//
//	 		// Text that will serve as the "dialog" portion of the chapter.
//	 		description = "";

// 
// 	// add more chapters here...

// 
// Once all the chapters have been added to quests.gas, the existing quests need to be in this format:
//

// 	[quest_for_gyorn]

Here, in the rugged mountains and rich valleys of their new home, they founded the Kingdom of Ehb... a Kingdom that has embraced peace and freedom for 300 years. But, there was a price... Few now remember the evil that opposed them. Fewer still recall the dark sorceries cast to save them.
