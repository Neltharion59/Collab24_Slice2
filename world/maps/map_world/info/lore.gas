	{
		description = "Carrying with them the written testaments of a dozen generations of faithful, Azunai's followers first appeared in the Agallan Peaks over two centuries before the founding of the Empire of Stars.\n\nShrines to the Eternal Passion began to dot Legionary routes as early as the 7th Century, offering free food and lodging to weary travelers willing to hear sermons on the deeds of Azunai. Within a hundred years of its introduction, over sixty villages in the Empire supported thriving communities of devout Azunite worshippers.\n\nThe simple Azunite doctrine of worldly rewards for hard labor was far easier to understand than the abstract, often unrewarding worship of the distant Stellar Emperors. Followers had only to profess a belief in the strength of The Defender and pass formally beneath his sacred shield, and they were accepted as a member of his clan. \n\nIt is believed that rare offspring of devout Azunite worshippers are 'Marked with fire' in secret ceremonies. Those children have been known to receive mortal wounds only to be resurrected by simple passage beneath the sacred shield.";

		description = "Designed by engineers of the 10th Legion, Castle Ehb was deemed to be the only impenetrable castle outside the Palace of Night in the Empire of Stars. Built on a massive hill of solid granite, flanked by the ancient dragon of Dragon's Rathe, and commanding a view for miles in all directions, the castle was declared by Legion commander Karese Noanni to be 'the most perfect thing made by human hands I've ever seen.'\n\nOriginally occupied by soldiers of the 10th Legion, it is now the principal residence of the crowned ruler of the Kingdom of Ehb. Below the palace levels of the royal family, the Legion quarter their command staff, and in the lowest levels, prisoners of various stripes serve out their sentences in the lightless holes of Ehb's bleak dungeons.\n\nDeep in the heart of the castle, there is one room which is not only hidden, but whose entry by anyone but the King or Queen carries with it an immediate penalty of death. The Chamber of Stars purportedly houses magical artifacts brought back from the War of Legions, whose enchantments were deemed too hazardous for mortals to behold.";

Here, the bodies and bones of all the Kings and Queens of Ehb are laid alongside the commanders, grand mages, and heroes of the 10th Legion.\n\nConsecrated by the returning 10th Legion as they fought to free Ehb from the tyranny of the Seck, the Crypt of the Sacred Blood is built on the site of one of the bloodiest battles of the Liberation.\n\nAs Legion Commander Karese Noanni surveyed the dead following the battle, he ordered that a space be cleared in the center and excavations be begun. 'From this day forth there shall be nothing accomplished that was not purchased with the blood of these valiant hearts,' Noanni is reported to have said.\n\nOver the centuries, wealthier families installed layer upon layer of secret passages and traps to discourage looters from disturbing their interred loved ones. Today the Crypt is considered unnavigable, and most burials are instead performed in graveyards surrounding the crypt entrances.";

	//5. Dragon's Rathe - In Sikra's inventory
	[lore_dragon]
	{
		description = "Just below the walls of Castle Ehb, a great blackened crack runs through the earth, marking the place where the worst of the Kingdom's criminals come to die. Given a sword, a bag of gold, and sometimes a shield, they are escorted to the mouth of the crevice. If they can defeat the five hundred year old dragon that lives within, they will be paroled to leave the Kingdom alive with all that they can carry out of the dragon's lair. \n\nOnly once in Kingdom history has anyone survived a bout with the dragon, escaping death on a technicality. Limping out of the hole with a fistful of gold, a scorched head of hair, and one eye, Hurggis Bogg had managed to slay a dragon--a four-day-old lame hatchling which he found by the entrance.\n\nThis tradition was begun by Karese Noanni, in an early effort to show solidarity with the native Droog in the Imperial Province, he publicly used the Rathe to punish a Legion soldier who had brutally attacked and murdered a Droog high priest. Later, the Kings and Queens of Ehb would adopt it as their own favored method of execution, allowing the prisoner the chance of escape in instances where the malfeasant's guilt was in some doubt.";

	//6. Droog - In the Spider Dungeon on a bookshelf.
	[lore_droog]
	{
		description = "Late in the 6th century, an Imperial trading company seeking alternative routes beyond the Green Range was startled to discover a large and thriving community living in the Cliffs of Fire.\n\nThe exceptional weapons and jewelry possessed by these simple cliffdwellers defied explanation, but the self-sufficient Droog could see no reason why they should exchange any of their valuables for the unappealing trinkets the Imperial traders had to offer.\n\nOver the next several years, trading companies tried and failed to interest the Droog, until one company presented a single gaudy bolt of fabric brought from the Imperial capitol among their wares. The Droog were instantly spellbound by the intricate pattern, and happily exchanged several of their finer weapons to the dumbstruck traders.\n\nWith visions of gold in their eyes, the small caravan hastily returned to the imperial capitol and secretly prepared wagonloads of the material for trading with the Droog. Unfortunately for them, between the capitol and the Droog lay a treacherous 730-league trade route which was frequently plagued by Goblin raids.\n\nAs luck would have it, the caravan was captured, and the Goblins learned of the Droog interest in the material from their captives. The Goblins had given up trying to trade with the Droog centuries earlier, and several industrious goblins immediately realized the value of their plunder.\n\nOver the course of six months, the small goblin band quietly circumvented the Legion patrols with bolts of cloth in tow, to arrive at the Cliffs of Fire, only to find they had been upstaged by a freelance trader named Etan Stonebridge. The Droog still saw value in the Goblin cargo, but due to Etan's previous dealings, were unwilling to part with their more valuable items in exchange. The Goblins were forced to retreat with a paltry quantity of baskets, unfinished beads, and some discarded Imperial mining equipment in exchange for their once-valuable bounty. \n\nThe Goblins never forgot Etan Stonebridge, and many years later would return to exact their revenge.";

	//7. Droog retribution: in Rhut's inventory.
	[lore_droog_2]
	{
		description = "By the year 604, the Droog Circle of the First was beginning to suspect that the strange, chattering races who now surrounded them were not intending to go away. If anything, their numbers seemed to be on the rise, and they were approaching the Cliffs of Fire with growing frequency. All of them seemed obsessed with trading goods of little or no value, but to speak of this infuriated them, while humoring them only kept them coming back.\n\nThe Droog knew that the various races disliked each other, and the Circle felt this could be a weakness to be exploited. The Droog formally announced a change of heart to the outsiders, and declared a great auction of weapons and jewelry to go only to the highest bidder.\n\nSeveral Imperial trading companies, Goblin tribes, and a Seck contingient converged on the Cliffs of Fire to partake in the bidding. The uneasy peace between the competing factions exploded when each group was informed that one of the other groups had stolen the treasures up for bid, and that the auction could not continue.\n\nThe ensuing skirmish quickly spilled across Ehb, and resulted in a two-year war of attrition between the Goblins, the Seck, and the 10th Legion. Though this bought the Droog a few short years of isolation, the well-entrenched Legion took the opportunity to reinforce their positions throughout Ehb, and in the aftermath, were better postured to deal with future insurgencies.\n\nTo the dismay of the Droog, the Cliffs of Fire were now encircled by Imperial holdings, and when proof of the Droog conspiracy reached the 10th Legion several years later, the Droog were forced to concede a major thoroughfare through their home city in exchange for remaining in their homes with a limited degree of autonomy.";

	//11. The Empire of Stars - With dead treasure Hunters in Water Dungeon.
	[lore_empire]
	{
		description = "For almost a thousand years, the vast Empire of Stars held sway over the eleven tribes of the Plain of Tears. Spanning at its height, all the territory from the Agallan Peaks to the Lescanza Peninsula, to the borders of modern Ehb, it was the second mightiest empire in all the history of the world. \n\nLed by a succession of ambitious, powerful, and often corrupt sorcerer Emperors and Empresses, it claimed a manifest destiny to rule everything beneath the sun. If not for the catastrophic intervention of the War of Legions, the Empire might well have lived to fulfill its darkest dreams, the domination of the entire globe. Some scribes argue that it still may, and that in no true sense did the Empire ever really fall.\n\nThe resting place of its last Emperor, Veransk III, has never been found, and most of the gruesome stories of his vivisection by the Legions can be traced back to the errant ramblings of retired Imperial soldiers. Many historians point to the fact that the scepter of the Empire passed west with the migration of the 10th Legion, and that the flourishing Kingdom of Ehb in many ways resembles the earliest days of the Empire.";

	//12. Fort Kroth: Lorun's Inventory
	[lore_fortkroth]
	{
		description = "Built following the Great Relocation, and fortified in the era of the War of Legions, Fortress Kroth is the only remnant of Seck architecture which still stands in the Kingdom. Used initially to repel the Droog's aggressions toward their newly arrived and unwanted neighbors, the fortress served only twice in official military capacity and was inhabited only for the twenty-three years that the Seck enjoyed freedom in Ehb. \n\nAmong the strangest features of the Fort is the underground Hall of Skulls, which was originally a mission built by human pilgrims from the east. The Seck captured and desecrated it, and used it as a storage hall, prison, and breeding farm for their spiders.\n\nFollowing the banishment of the Seck, Fortress Kroth was abandoned, preserved by edict to stand always as a reminder of the Seck and their ultimate betrayal of the Kingdom of Ehb. But despite its lack of living occupants, the fortress was rumored to be very much alive even two hundred years after the last occupants were executed by Kingdom soldiers. \n\nHuman screams were said to come from its basements at all hours, a terrifying recollection of the horrors committed by the Seck during their brief takeover of Ehb. Another phantom occurrence associated with the fort are the occasional discoveries of Seck arrows driven into trees within bowshot range of Kroth's walls, despite the fact that nothing of their kind has been manufactured for centuries.";

	//13. Goldsniffer Mags: Gloern's Inventory
	[lore_goldsniffer]
	{
		description = "A direct descendant of the mule packs imported by Etan Stonebridge, 'Mags' was one of the most remarkable animals ever to tread the Glitterdelve's stony passages.\n\nPreferring to wander the darkness of the mines than be above, she often would chew her way free of her restraints, only to be found hours later standing near exposed veins of gold. In time, other miners began to experiment with 'Goldsniffer' Mags' gold-homing nose, discovering to their fortune that she possessed an uncanny knack of gravitating to undiscovered deposits of rare metals.\n\nBut Mags could also be temperamental, and sometimes demonstrated her pique by leading miners to drill barren shafts which the locals began to call 'Mag Holes.' Beloved for her unusual talent, she easily would have been remembered in the history books of the Glitterdelve, but it was her actions during the Great Blast of 943 which would forever ingrain her into the hearts and minds of her keepers.\n\nFollowing the accidental ignition of unvented gases in a newly hewn coal shaft, the passages of the mine became a howling death trap of flame and flying rock for those trapped within.\n\nWhether disoriented by the blast, or truly perceiving what had occurred, Mags broke free from her restraints and plunged into the roiling black smoke of the mine, even as stunned dwarves and men bolted from the fury of the roaring catastrophe.\n\nVanishing from the sight of terrified onlookers for nearly a quarter hour, Mags at last stumbled from the mine, dragging three half-dead miners by the trailing rope of her broken harness. Able only to stagger a few yards from the entrance with her tremendous burden, 'Goldsniffer' Mags collapsed in a wheezing heap, never to rise again.\n\nHaving pulled the last survivors of the Great Blast to safety, Mags died the following morning, surrounded by weeping men who knew her for the one-time miracle she truly was.\n\nEighteen years later, the monument to her final heroism would be constructed at the very spot she died.";

	//14. Glitterdelve - used in Glacern Book quest
	[lore_glitterdelve]
	{
		description = "For all the natural wonders of Fedwyrr's Way, the folk of the Kingdom have wrought a number of miracles on their own while improving conditions in the Glitterdelve Mine. Chief among them was the gigantic sorcerous delving machine originally fashioned by the first mages of the kingdom to assist in underground excavations for the construction of Castle Ehb. Elevators and conveyors drawn on belts and winches allowed miners and materials to move between levels with astonishing rapidity. Sluices running melted ice and snow down from Glacern provided fresh drinking water for the miners, and a medium in which gold could be separated from the rocky silts.\n\nTragedy struck the mines in the Great Blast of 943, when a buildup of explosive vapors touched off a chain reaction that buried many of the more valuable veins beneath tons of rock, and reduced the delving machine to a useless pile of scrap. Since that time, the circulation of air has been maintained by a series of magically powered fans.\n\nIn many respects, the post-Blast generation of Glitterdelve miners had to reinvent the art of mining. Those who came to the Glitterdelve in search of the Kingdom's greatest source of wealth were often startled by the austerity of its camps. Aside from the base necessities of a smelting forge, mule trading barn, and the Coughing Jak Tavern, there were few permanent structures to be found.\n\nIn the decades since, little has changed in this insular community of rugged mountain-men, miners, and self-styled individualists. So long as gold still glitters in the seams of rock, and the Kingdom's tax collectors leave them with a coin to spend in the local tavern, they are content to be citizens of Ehb.";

	//15. Fedwyrr's Way - used in Glacern Book quest
	[lore_fedwyrr]
	{
		description = "In the fifth century, before the coming of the Imperial traders and the 10th Legion, the first record of the wonders that would one day be known collectively as Fedwyrr's Way was penned by the famed Agallan cartographers Fedwyrr and Klars. They described the network of natural caverns as 'a cramped, stinking, and altogether foul series of holes' and noted it in their journals as the only means by which the Green Range could be traversed.\n\nWinding through miles of mineral-bearing rock where Frostspire Mountain collides with the Green Range, Fedwyrr's Way varies from open air fissures barely wide enough for a man to slide through to caverns 'vast enough for a litter of dragon whelps to spread their wings.'\n\nMarking their way along with luminous stones chipped from rocky outcroppings, the explorers left behind a legacy that would later guide Imperial traders and the 10th Legion into the interior of Ehb. To this day, the mineral-rich Glitterdelve, slippery Alpine Caverns, and phosphor-littered Subterranean River are still the primary path by which travelers pass between Mount Frostspire and the Green Range.\n\nExploratory shafts dug in the 8th century revealed the presence of iron, driving Imperial traders to push harder for Droog concessions in the region. Later, the discovery of gold and coal fueled the expansion of the early Kingdom, while regular mine shafts began to shore up the sometimes unpredictable interior of Mount Frostspire.";

	//18. Swords to Plowshares: Bookshelf in Spider Dungeon
	[lore_swords]
	{
		description = "By 844, Karese Noanni had been the guiding light of his beloved 10th for over twenty years. Under his direction, the Legion had become one of most versatile military units ever known, weathering the hardships of the pacification of the Lescanza and the War of Legions with minimal casualties.\n\nBut with all but a few of the Legion's most notorious enemies vanquished, the 10th faced a crisis of identity. The Empire they were sworn to serve was gone and brawling in the ranks was becoming endemic. 'Under all the stars, there is nothing more wretched than a soldier without an enemy to fight,' a frustrated fifty-two year old Noanni wrote in the annals. 'I've had enough of blood that a hectare of soil, a spade, and mule will content me well until my end, if it must, but what am I to do with these youths of fire?'\n\nOn the first day of the new year, addressing a freezing and apprehensive assembly of his men, Karese Noanni declared that the 10th Legion as they knew it could no longer survive. Food supplies were dwindling, a shortage of farmers and an overabundance of Legionairres primarily at fault. If they were to capitalize on their good fortune, it would mean dismantling everything they had ever known and constructing a new kingdom to withstand the ravages of time.\n\nImmediately, there were calls for Noanni to assume the newly proposed throne of Ehb, but he graciously declined, saying the new Kingdom of Ehb would still need an army, and it was his intention to lead it through the difficult times ahead. Refugees from other parts of the Empire were already presenting themselves, seeking shelter from the chaos on the Plain of Tears. Behind them, he suspected, would soon come visitors of a less benevolent nature as word of Ehb's singular good fortunes leaked out.";

	//21. Etan Stonebridge: On pedestal in Crypts
	[lore_stonebridge_1]
	{
		description = "Etan Stonebridge was no stranger to the world of trading. Having grown up poor in the streets of the Imperial Capitol of Iliyara, he'd spent much of his youth parlaying stolen eggs or broken bits of glass into a warm evening meal. \n\nDuring a brief stint in the 2nd Legion, he'd learned a bit about horse-trading and had become an expert in sniffing out bad deals, but the mindless tedium of the military lifestyle didn't suit Stonebridge's notions of adventure. He abandoned his post in 596 to join a small westward-bound trading company.\n\nShortly after arriving in Ehb, Stonebridge was introduced to the Droog, and became convinced they had more to offer than the exotic weapons and jewelry other companies were failing to acquire. He'd briefly glimpsed the Droog using eggshell-like material as thick as a man's hand with a glorious oily sheen to it; judging by the way they were pounding it, it had to be harder than granite. Acquiring even a few lots of the stuff to tile the floors of some wealthy patrician's villa might put a nice jingle in his pouch.\n\nIt was a stroke of luck that the Droog held no value in the shells, and were actually glad to be rid of them. They were even happier to receive in exchange many of the items that had previously been offered in trade for their treasured weapons and jewelry.\n\nAs time passed, the Droog became more comfortable dealing with Etan, and eventually offered him limited exchanges of Droog weaponry despite their refusal to all other parties. Etan's wealth grew quickly during these years, and by the time of the Droog retribution, he had established himself as one of Ehb's wealthiest citizens.";

	//23. Wesrin Cross: Empty, partially burned house in Stonebridge.
	[lore_wesrin]
	{
		description = "Only an hour's march south of Frostspire Pass, the lonely ruins of Wesrin Cross have borne witness to some of the darkest hours of Ehb's turbulent history. Originally constructed as an Inn by Imperial trader Fiola Wesrin sometime in the 7th century, it has served, at times, as a barracks, a menagerie, a gatehouse, and a royal residence. The sheer volume of blood shed in its shadow has made it a tormented place, haunted with memories of the birth of the Kingdom.\n\nWith the arrival of the Seck and the Imperial forces from the east, the site was heavily re-fortified by the 10th Legion, and a gated underground route linked to recent excavations made from the Glitterdelve mine.\n\nDuring the War of Legions, the Seck briefly occupied the tunnels, using them to house a corps of Guild spider drovers. While the subterranean confinement pens were later torn out by the reoccupying Legion forces, a magical homing taint remained in the tunnels, which continues to attract the descendants of the Seck-controlled Arakun spiders to this day.\n\nFollowing the completion of new fortifications north of Frostspire Pass in 935, Wesrin Cross was at last deemed unsuitable for continued military use. Retiring it with full honors, the fortress was turned over to royal family of Ehb. It would stand vacant for the next fifteen years.\n\nIn 970, Edvard the 'Goblin Pretender' became the last man to officially occupy Wesrin Cross. Refurbishing its crumbling ceilings and chambers at extravagantly wasteful costs, he employed over forty goblin engineers working day and night to prevent its seemingly imminent collapse.\n\nIn the end, it would be here, at the first fortress of Ehb, that the 10th Legion would do battle with their treasonous grand mage Olvis, and Wesrin Cross would, sadly, be laid waste by order of its last and most ambitious architect.";

	//24. Ibsen Yamas - On cot in Tower after Stonebridge.
	[lore_ibsen]
	{
		description = "Ibsen Yamas has the distinction of having been declared dead more often than any other soldier in the history of the 10th Legion. He was said to be beaten by Goblin raiders at Frostspire Pass in 965, only to turn the battle into a bloody rout of the Goblin forces three days later. In 987, he was said to have died in a snowstorm while retrieving his beloved mule Caprine, only to turn up a week later, hungry and irritated by a hole in his boot.\n\nFor his allies, the stories of his death are a source of frequent amusement; to his enemies, a wishful dream. He has said that death will only take him when he's gotten too bored or too tired of living, and even then the reaper had better bring heavy reinforcements.\n\nBorn in the Agallan Peaks in 944 and raised by a former cook of the 10th Legion, Ibsen headed west for the Kingdom of Ehb as a courier for the Azunite Synod at the age of sixteen. In 961, he arrived at Castle Ehb and presented a recommendation that he be assigned to his mother's post, but his cooking was found to be inferior to his soldiering, and he found himself very shortly thereafter in the command of his platoon, and, not much later, his company.\n\nAssigned to maintain order along Fedwyrr's Way during the affair of the Goblin Pretender, Ibsen met a band of Goblin soldiers besieging the Iron Tower of Glacern and beat them back, sending all but a few of his men on to help in the defense of the mines. Days later, he defeated two full platoons attempting to press past Glacern into the eastern Kingdom, effectively holding the Goblin threat at bay until they at last retreated.\n\nFormally resigning from military service in 994, he became the Overseer of the western realm, supervising the fortification and security of Glacern while also becoming the manager of the Kingdom's mines. Although retired, he is one of the most respected strategists of the old Legion, and is frequently consulted as the unofficial ruler of everything below Glacern.";

	[lore_fedwyrr_3]
	{
		description = "A series of caverns, originally discovered by the Agallan explorers Fedwyrr and Klars, extends from the frozen Caves just north of Glacern to the great dark forest at the base of the Green Range, occasionally surfacing in the arctic wilderness above. Travelers along the route are treated to a vast array of subterranean waterfalls, bright crystal outcroppings, and thermal plumes of a size unmatched elsewhere in Aranna.\n\nThe most difficult challenge to the travelers of these routes, other than the loose, slippery footing and narrow passageways, are the myriad of creatures that call the caverns home. Among these creatures are the fiercely territorial Trog, a race that at one time dominated the undermountain passageways that parallel Fedwyrr's Way.\n\nSeveral campaigns of the 10th Legion sought to clear the Trog menace and establish a secure trade route through the Alpine Caverns. These campaigns never managed to eliminate the Trog, but a subsequent increase in a variety of other more reclusive creatures did result. The surviving Trog are considerably less aggressive, though they still present considerable danger when encountered in groups of more than two.\n\nMaintaining the safety of the caverns requires regular Legion patrols, dispatched from Glacern, a luxury which can only be afforded in times of peace. In times of war, withdrawal of the patrols means many other native creatures return to the passageways, among them mischievous lungers, and crystalline creatures of various colors, shapes, and sizes.";
