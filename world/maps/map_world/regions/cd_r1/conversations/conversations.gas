Three hundred years ago, our ancestors entombed Commander Gom with the remnants of his Seck army, following their craven surrender to the 10th Legion. Rather than obliterate the remains of their race, our forefathers magically bound them one by one in the Vault of Eternity as a sentence for their savagery against our people. It would appear the magical wards have weakened during Merik's long absence. The Seck that imprisoned me here somehow breached our castle defenses and caught us unaware. Unlike the rest of my retinue, I was spared, but I am sure they were simply holding me for some unspeakable sacrifice. Were it not for your rescue, they would eventually have figured out that I hold this key.\nWithin the bowels of this castle there is a hidden sanctuary known as the Chamber of Stars. If what you say is true, the Seck must be plotting to acquire the Imperial relics concealed therein. They could possibly hold the power to revive their dark lord Gom and the rest of their kin. You should hurry to retrieve the artifacts from the Chamber to safeguard them. If any of them can be of use to you, so much the better. Once the artifacts are secure, I charge you to seek out, and vanquish the remaining Seck before their dark vengeance can be unleashed on the good folk of Ehb... You have become our last bastion of hope. I shall remain here and pray for the deliverance of our kingdom at your hands. May Azunai bless and guard you in your crusade... Heroes of Ehb.";
