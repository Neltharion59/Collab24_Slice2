Not having seen much in my life besides ponds and underground rivers, I was excited about the opportunity. However, soon after those undead bodies attacked us, I lost a couple of shovels, which she says I owe her money for. From mud to peddle, as they say.\n\nListen, if you were to pay for the shovels, I might become an escort for you. I wager it won't be worse than serving my previous masters.";

But that's another story. Anyway, a wish is a wish, and I decided to honor it. I set out for the town of Frostfingers, to learn how to do merchanting right. You see, a few moments ago, I tried to help this traveler pushing a cart across this bridge. However, he panicked, and pressed his mules harder to pull his cart. A little too harder, it seems. The mules misstepped and fell down onto the stalagmites along with the cart. The man looked at the scene in horror, and started to run. I understand it is hard to believe that such low price for Phrak bacon is suspicious, but I think he overreacted. I would like to set things right with him. He murmured something about being home soon to one of the mules before I approached them. Listen, would you mind dropping a good word for me? He probably lives nearby. I believe a third person might reason with him more successfully. I cannot become a merchant with such a debt with a potential customer.";
