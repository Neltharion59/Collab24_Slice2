My mother Suvanne, the queen of fae has disgraced our kind. A lowly flamboyant drakeling dared to show his face and our lands, and she submitted, cowardly fleeing in terror. That is when she lost the right to rule and she knows that. I seeked to challenge her to a duel, as is our custom, to ensure my succession. But first, I asked the ice witches for help. They laughed, they mocked me, and froze me in this cave. Insulence? Politics? I followed my destiny. Lucky you to have freed me, for the gratitute of the new fae queen is the highest honor a mortal can posses. Now, I shall complete what started. Be on your way stranger, for the things shall get ugly soon.";
