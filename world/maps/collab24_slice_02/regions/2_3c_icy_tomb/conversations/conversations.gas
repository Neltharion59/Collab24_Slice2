My mother Suvanne, the queen of fae, has disgraced our kind. A lowly flamboyant drakeling dared to show his face and our lands, and she submitted, cowardly fleeing in terror. That is when she lost the right to rule and she knows that. I seeked to challenge her to a duel, as is our custom, to ensure my succession. But first, I asked the ice witches for help. They laughed at me and mocked me. I tried to steal their tomes of power, but one of them caught me and froze me in this cave. Lucky you to have freed me, for the gratitute of a fae queen is the highest honor a mortal can posses. And I'll soon be one. Now, I shall complete what started. Be on your way stranger, for the things shall get ugly soon.";
