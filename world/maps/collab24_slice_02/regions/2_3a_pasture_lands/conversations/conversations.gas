See, I am of the Taerie tribe. We were chased out of our homelands by rival tribes, more numerous and aggressive than we were. We finally found our new home in the mountains and seek to forge alliances with our neighbours, both distant and close ones. It was my task to address the town called Frostfingers.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems my passing has drawn attention of the snow  leopards. They must have followed me, and once we reached the pasturelands, they would gladly prey upon the local livestock. The locals quickly withdrew within their walls, so here I remain, isolated from the town, under constant watch of the preying leopards.\n\nHowever, with a brave soul such as yourself, we might have a chance to defeat them. Let us go down from this tower first.";
